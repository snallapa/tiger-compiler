# Tiger Compiler
A partner and I created a tiger compiler for CS4410 Compilers.
This was created in SML and was translated to MIPS assembly language. 
We implemented a Parser, Lexer, Semantic Analysis, Frame Analysis,
Translation to IR, Instruction selection, Register Allocation, and
Integration.
